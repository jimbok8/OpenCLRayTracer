To build the libraries succesfully you will need:

	1.BOOST libraries - At version 0.6 - No necessary to build. I used BOOST 1_59_0 for this project
	2.OpenCL SDK - I used AMD APP SDK, however I tried to minimize dependence on specific SDK as much as I could.
        	       You may also try and use another SDK (Intel, for example) - Should work too, but I didn't test it
	3.glut and OpenGL libraries - Those usually come with the OpenCL SDK examples

Once you got the libraries, add their "include" directories to 
"Additional Include Directories" in Visual Studio property pages, for each project.
Also, make sure that the path to headers of the library is also set correctly.

Also, don't forget to add the additional libraries to:
	Linker->Input->Additional Dependencies
or      
	Librarian->Additional dependencies

in Visual Studio Property Pages.

Following libraries should be added:
OpenCL.lib
opengl32.lib
glu32.lib
glut32.lib
glew32.lib
GLEW32.lib

Once that is done - You are ready to go!
Use batch files in "bin" directory to run the demo and see some ray traced models.
